# Contributing to open-library

We’re glad you want to contribute! **open-library** is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. Whether you’re submitting a new tutorial, fixing a typo, or enhancing an existing resource, your contributions are highly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository so you can make changes to your own copy. Once you've made your changes, submit a pull request (PR) with your changes.

### 2. Create a Branch for Your Changes
We recommend creating a separate branch for each contribution. For example:

```

### 3. Write Content in Markdown Format
All contributions should be written in Markdown (`.md`) format. Please structure your content clearly and use the following naming conventions for files:
- Use descriptive names like `template-literal-types.md` for a TypeScript topic.
- Follow the existing directory structure (e.g., `/TypeScript/`, `/Python/`).

### 4. Format Your Code Snippets
Make sure that any code snippets you provide are properly formatted using code blocks. For example:

\```typescript
const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`;
\```

### 5. Test Your Changes
Ensure that your changes don’t break any content or cause formatting issues. You can view the content by previewing the Markdown files on GitHub.
